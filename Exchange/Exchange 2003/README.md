# PowerShellScripts

Exchange 2003 doesn't support PowerShell, but these scripts can be used perfectly with Windows Server 2008 R2 Domain Controllers.
There are enough organizations who are still using Exchange 2003 and want to prefer to migrate to a new version of Exchange or Exchange Online.

When using the export scripts, make sure to specify the right Search Base where the Exchange 2003 objects are stored, like:

	- Distribution Groups
	- Mail enabled users
